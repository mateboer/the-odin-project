    </h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML boilerplate. (paragraph)</p>
    <p>This is a simple <em>italic (emphasized)</em></p>
    <p>This is a simple <strong>bold (strong)</strong></p>
    <p>This is a simple <a href="#">link (anchor)</a></p>
    <!-- This is a simple comment -->
    <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: (unordered list)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt; is represented by &amp;lt (less than)</li>
        <li>&gt; is represented by &amp;gt (greater than)</li>
        <li>&amp; is represented by &amp;amp (ampersand)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
